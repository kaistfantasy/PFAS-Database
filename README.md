# PFAS-Database
Abstract
Receptor-based detection of emerging environmental toxicants, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), is challenging due to their diverse chemical types. We developed a novel method of “dipping” the paper chips into water samples with a set of biologically interacting molecules (BIMs) to evaluate the extent of molecular interactions between PFAS and the BIM set. The System Automated Loading for Sample Analysis (SALSA) was introduced to ensure consistent and automated sample delivery onto paper chips. A smartphone captured video clips of capillary action, and cloud analysis evaluated the flow velocities, which were correlated with PFAS-BIM interactions. A comprehensive database of over 10,000 flow profiles was collected for each type of water samples, including mineral water, groundwater, and effluent wastewater. The optimized machine learning algorithm successfully classified 1) PFAS versus no PFAS, and 2) PFAS type. This integrated system demonstrates a reliable, portable, and scalable solution for on-site PFAS detection. 

Data and Code Availability
Custom Python code for the automatic acquisition of capillary flow profiles from video clips, as well as a random forest Python script for machine learning classification, have been provided in this github repository.
